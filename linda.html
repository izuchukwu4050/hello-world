    Ex Beauty queen Ibidun-ituah Ighadalo today shared lovely pictures of herself and her adorable two adopted children,Keke And 
Zenan. In a post shared on her IG page, on how God made her welcome the choice of adopting children.Ituah and her clergyman husband 
Pastor Ighadalo got married in 2007 and are yet to have children. She did interview this year talking on how struggle to have children
Read what she wrote below...</p>

<p id="demo" style="display:none">where do i start? you are such a loving and kind father its incomparable. your wisdom and knowledge is unrivaled as is your knowledge.you know 
the end from the beginning and the beginning from the end as time really exists in you.
you knew me before you formed me and my life's journey and you prepared me every step on the way... my choice of a life partner thougn questioned 
by many was a divine masterpiece by you... you already saw the struggles and you knew the perfect fit for me... you knew who could handle the storms 
of life with me and you blessed me with a wonderful husband,friend and lover. Ever so supportive and loving. supportive through almost a dozen episode of IVF 
never wavering there for every doctors tests and appointment. with all the societal pressures and shaming you held me and comforted me in my low times. 
Even that didnt work out you were already something mind blowing. how else could explain the burden you laid in my husband's heart to establish an orphanage 
even before our marriage. this same orphanage gave me my beautiful daugther whom your hand is in her life. Born on the same day as myself and named by her dad 
 with and brought to the orphanage. even when i didnt recognise your hand it was there till our eyes saw what was in front of us. Again ever supportive my husband
was in support for us to go in that direction. the way you pieced our lives jigsaw puzzles astounds me continually papa. Out of the blue a call comes to my phone 
and my darling aunt says i have seen your son. Come and pick him... not a clue to the process i started in faith and you made a way Zenan became ours... even when 
am not thinking of myself you were thinking of me and putting my thought in the heart of people. seeing my son is a i would never forget. The bond was instant and the 
love was in full flow. How could i have orchestrated my life as perfectly as you have done. Am so glad i have you papa because your ways are not my ways and your hands 
are evident in my life.
Thank you father for making a way of guiding me, for holding me, for giving me joy, for sending me peace and for completely showing my family favour. papa my prayer will
not be complete if i dont ask you to open the eyes of other women out there trusting you for the fruit of the womb to have an open mind to different ways of becoming a 'MOTHER'
So many children are out there looking for a home and place to call their own home.I pray they experience the joy of motherhood as i do now and to open their hearts to you 
to listen as many options as you have provided.... adoption doesnt mean you have failed them but is a way of showing the blessings you have in store for them but only if they will 
if only they will yield to you... a bless which is priceless i thank you for my two adorable kids, i could never trade them for anything in the world... looking forward on your  
instruction on after more children???</p>

    St George's Chapel in Windsor...</p>
    <p id="demo2" style="display:none">
    There have been speculations to as what the bride will wear, well! she's beautifully clad in a backless, and a tiara 
    borrowed from  her grandmother queen Elizbeth. She has on no veil and still looks very beautiful on every bit as the princess she is.

    Her low backed gown shows the scars from a back operation aged 12, and can be seen as her father walked her down the steps.
    Inside the church, the husband-to-be looked nervous as he waited for the bride to arrive and then he grinned widely and said: "you look perfect".
